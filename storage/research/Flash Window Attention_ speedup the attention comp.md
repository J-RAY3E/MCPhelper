# Flash Window Attention: speedup the attention computation for Swin Transformer

## Resumen

To address the high resolution of image pixels, the Swin Transformer introduces window attention. This mechanism divides an image into non-overlapping windows and restricts attention computation to within each window, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. To further optimize this process...
